/**
 * validate-reference-links.js
 *
 * Guards links from skills to the shared `references/` checklists.
 *
 * Those checklists live in the repo-root `references/` directory, but every
 * SKILL.md used to link them as `references/<file>.md` — a path relative to
 * the skill's own directory, which is two levels below the root. All 18 links
 * across 11 skills resolved to files that do not exist, in the repo and in
 * every plugin-install layout (~/.claude/plugins/cache/..., ~/.codex/...).
 * Agents that followed the guidance — for example using-agent-skills pointing
 * at the Definition of Done — hit a file-not-found and stalled.
 *
 * Nothing else in CI catches this: validate-artifact-paths.js is scoped to
 * spec/plan/todo artifacts and is explicitly not a general markdown linter.
 *
 * The rule enforced here: every `references/*.md` link in a SKILL.md must
 * resolve to an existing file relative to that skill's own directory. This
 * accepts both conventions in CLAUDE.md — shared checklists reached via
 * `../../references/`, and a skill's own colocated `references/` directory.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow: only `references/*.md` links, only SKILL.md
 * files. It is not a general markdown path linter — skills legitimately
 * mention paths that do not exist yet (`tasks/todo.md`, `PERF.md`,
 * `docs/ideas/[idea-name].md`), and those must not fail the build.
 *
 * Fenced code blocks are exempt for the same reason. Text inside a fence is
 * an example, not a link an agent will follow — and this rule in particular
 * has to be documentable: the failure message below tells authors to write
 * `../../references/<file>.md` rather than `references/<file>.md`, which no
 * skill could show as an example without failing the very check explaining it.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = all clear, 1 = one or more unresolvable links.

 * Scans line by line rather than matching one regex over the document, so the
 * three fence forms CommonMark allows are all handled: tilde fences, fences
 * indented up to three spaces, and a closing fence longer than its opener. A
 * fence closes only on the same marker character repeated at least as many
 * times, so a ``` line inside a ~~~ block does not end it.
 *
 * Deliberately local rather than shared with `scripts/lib/skill-lint.js`:
 * that module's `stripFencedCodeBlocks` is a single regex with the gaps
 * described in #437, and #444 is already rewriting it. Duplicating a correct
 * scanner here is the smaller cost than forking a rewrite in flight; once
 * #444 lands, the two should collapse into one helper under `scripts/lib/`.
